# Description

Delani-studio is a web application that illustrates what projects we do as a design studio. It includes
a portfolio of some of our projects, and a detailed description of what we do
from inception to completion of the project. Further to this, the application is
built to incoporate bootsrap styling, styles.css and jQuery. The application
also includes a form that allows users to enter their names and emails.
